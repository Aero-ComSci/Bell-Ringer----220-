Binary Flipplin -- Binary Bangers


Fix the lyrics First to get their pulled request wins!

[Verse]
Zeros and ones they dance in the night
Flickering lights they shine so bright
In the binary world it's all black and white
Positive or negative ain't no fight

[Verse 2]
Flip the bits and add a one
Two's complement starts the fun
Negative numbers aren't that dumb
Just rearranged under the binary sun

[Chorus]
Binary love flip the bits and go
Negative feelings simply overflow
From zero down to thirty-two
In the end it’s all just ones and zeros

[Verse 3]
If you see a leading one
That’s how you know it's begun
Negative numbers on the run
Counting down till they’re done

[Bridge]
32 bits in a row
High to low they neatly flow
From minus two to the thirty-two
All compacted in this binary show

[Chorus]
Binary love flip the bits and go
Negative feelings simply overflow
From zero down to thirty-two
In the end it’s all just ones and zeros
